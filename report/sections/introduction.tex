\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}

Deep neural networks have become the de facto standard tool in many computer
vision tasks, but other methods prevail for different tasks. The most popular
and succesful method for regression on tabular data, at least on Kaggle, is
gradient boosting decision trees~\cite{guo2016entity}.

In this report we look at different and less popular approaches to large scale
regression. We try to estimate a function mapping taxi ride parameters to the
corresponding price for $55M$ records.

We will first investigate neural networks, using entity embeddings for the
categorical inputs as is common practice in neural language processing and has
been applied to a similar problem to ours by De Br{\'e}bisson et
al.~\cite{de2015artificial}.

We will then move on to investigate a more uncommon method and try different
methods of applying Gaussian processes to the problem.

Finally we compare all our methods to gradient boosting decision trees.
